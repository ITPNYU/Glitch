# Glitch

This repository started in 2012 as `ITPG-GT.2944.1`, a class at ITP lead by [Kyle McDonald](http://kylemcdonald.net/) and [Jeremiah Johnson](http://nullsleep.com/). For more information about this class see the [syllabus](http://shareglitch.tumblr.com/post/31034897201/syllabus) and the [class tumblr](shareglitch.tumblr.com/).

In 2014 it evolved into a workshop, taught by Kyle first at [CLICK Festival](http://clickfestival.dk/program/glitch) and then [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/speaker/kyle-mcdonald/).
